# DC Motor PID Control with Brake Disturbance and State Classification

## Overview
This repository presents the design and implementation of a discrete PID control system for a DC motor subjected to external mechanical disturbances generated by a braking mechanism.

The controller ensures reference tracking while compensating for load variations. The system behavior is analyzed to identify multiple functional operating states, which are classified using concrete and fuzzy Artificial Intelligence techniques.

This project was developed as part of a Mechatronics Engineering course focused on control systems and intelligent monitoring.

## System Description
The system consists of:
- A DC motor driven by a power stage.
- A braking mechanism used to introduce controlled mechanical disturbances.
- Sensors for speed and/or position feedback.
- A discrete PID controller implemented in MATLAB.
- A data acquisition system for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Objectives
- Design and tune a discrete PID controller for DC motor speed regulation.
- Analyze the motor response under different brake-induced disturbances.
- Identify and characterize multiple functional operating states.
- Implement concrete and fuzzy classifiers for state detection.
- Compare the performance of both classification approaches.

## Methodology
1. **DC Motor Modeling**
   - Electrical and mechanical modeling of the DC motor.
   - Transfer function identification.

2. **PID Control Design**
   - Discrete PID tuning and implementation.
   - Validation of reference tracking and disturbance rejection.

3. **Disturbance Analysis**
   - Application of controlled braking torques.
   - Data acquisition under different load conditions.

4. **Functional State Definition**
   - Multivariable analysis of motor behavior.
   - Identification of at least five functional states.

5. **State Classification**
   - Concrete classifier (e.g., K-Means).
   - Fuzzy classifier (e.g., Fuzzy C-Means).
   - Comparative analysis of classification accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies
- MATLAB
- Control Systems Toolbox
- Signal Processing
- Machine Learning (Clustering)
- Fuzzy Logic Toolbox
- Data Visualization

## Results
The PID controller successfully compensates for brake-induced disturbances while maintaining reference tracking with minimal steady-state error.
Both classifiers demonstrate effective identification of the motor's functional operating states, enabling real-time system supervision.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the integration of classical DC motor control with intelligent classification techniques, providing a robust framework for monitoring and diagnosis in mechatronic systems.
